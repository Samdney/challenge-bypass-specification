# challenge-bypass-specification

This repository contains the formal specification for a protocol that has been developed to allow bypassing challenge pages using signed tokens that guarantee anonymity to the user. The following files are of use:

- captcha-bypass-formal-spec.txt: Original specification of protocol along with the algorithms that are required to instantiate it. The draft is heavily based on a preceding work by George Tankersley and Filippo Valsorda except with alterations where the design has changed since it's original conception.
- captcha-bypass-internet-draft.txt: The most current draft of a document intended to be submitted as an IETF internet draft proposal. Focuses on defining the different phases of the protocol and how extensions can be built in. All changes should be made to the markdown document captcha-bypass-formal-spec.md and then compiled using mmark and xml2rfc into the text document.

We encourage comments/feedback on the designs and the drafts themselves.
